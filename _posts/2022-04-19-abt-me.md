```Do you know where those strange symbols come from in your txts? Or whether 'spade' and 'Spade' are the same word? Or perhaps you've been wondering how computers know where words begin? I'm here to answer all your questions and make sure you don't run into any problems.```

  Got a txt file that needs to be  
- segmented into sentences
- tokenized
- filtered for profanity

And then you want it all printed prettily? Fear not! [This](https://gitlab.uzh.ch/yuliia.frund/exercise-1) handy program will do it all and more.




But what if your file is a csv and you want a nifty text generator? Check [me](https://gitlab.uzh.ch/yuliia.frund/exercise-2) out! I might be just what you need.




Don't want to deal with annoying txt's and py's? That's ok, we all need a break sometimes. Why not use a nicely pack(ag)ed [program](https://gitlab.uzh.ch/yuliia.frund/exercise3) with simple args?



Ahhh beloved encoding: you get it right and life is great, you get it wrong and everything ~~breaks~~ needs a bit more work. And why not change formats, too? Jason or Exemel? The [choice](https://gitlab.uzh.ch/yuliia.frund/exercise-4) is yours.
