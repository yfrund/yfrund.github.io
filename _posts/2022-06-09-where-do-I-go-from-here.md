Are you lost at the ZÃ¼rich main station? Do you have absolutely no idea where to go and what to visit first? Worry not - this little [program](https://github.com/yfrund/destination) will help you plan your day! Just type the names of two destinations and you'll immediately know which one's closer and whether they're open today! Have fun and remember: there's no such thing as too much chocolate or cheese!
